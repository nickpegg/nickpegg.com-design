## I'm bad at CSS

I'm currently thinking about overhauling my personal website and the [static site tool I wrote](https://github.com/nickpegg/posty) which powers it. This is my attempt at using Bootstrap to do things right.

Still very much a work in progress, mostly just me stumbling around with CSS having no idea what I'm doing.
